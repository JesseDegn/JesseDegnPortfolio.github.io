											For the first Part of this project, I had to learn two different 3D design programs. TinkerCAD and Fusion. Despite being used for the same thing, they had many differences. TinkerCADâ€™s program overall was much simpler, from when it came to the tutorial to actually making designs. The instructions and steps were very basic and never got overly complicated. Youc could easily change the size and shapes of you designs. The toolbar was very basic and even had small little visual representations of what each tool did to make it so you knew exactly what you were doing. This is definitely a website oriented for beginners and people making designs that are not that complicated. At the same time, Fusion is more like the advanced version of TinkerCad. They both do the same thing, but fusion does it in a much more detailed way. Where can you build your 3D designs from 2D sketches. The tutorial given, although very helpful, was much longer and more detailed than the one for Tinker. It requires much more time to become proficient in the program. Despite this, both of the programs served almost identical purposes, where the same thing can be done on both of them. In the image above, you can see a ring I made with my initials on it. The top photo is the one from fusion, where I struggled a lot more. The grid feature on Fusion is much more complex than when I was creating the sketch of my text I struggled with choosing the correct axis so that the letters could line up along the ring. Even the alignment itself was much more difficult; you can see in that photo that I was unable to make the text horizontal across the ring because it was so hard to understand the Emboss feature. While on TInkerCad, which is the ring in the bottom photo, all I had to do was group the letters to each other than the ring and just rotate them. I never had to worry about which axis to click ot or what an Emboss tool was. This ring design came out much better compared to the one made on Fusion, where the letters go horizontally across the center of the ring.

										<p>For the main part of this project I had to redesign a public 3D model. Which I did to create a headphone stand for my over the head head phones. They rest over the curve so they can be standing instead of laying somewhere randomly on my desk. I then added A hexagon shape into the middle of the print as a way to also place my earbuds making this entire project a way to neatly store all my types of headphones. As a final addition to label it as my own creation I had my last named indented into the base of the print. This can be seen in the top left image of the collage above which is my final two prints from both the prgrams (grey is TinkerCAD and pink is Fusion). To start this design process I found other 3D models of headphones stands to use for inspiration than brain stormed ideas to customize and repurpose to make it my own. After doing this I  Sketched out how the build would look on paper so i could visualize every part and get the measurements down because I had also measured my headphones height to know how tall the stand needed to be. The only real struggle of this was converting the inches I measured of my headphones and earbuds case in inches and converting them into millimiters because that is the units TinkerCAD uses. Although Fusion can use inches which eliminated that challenge for me when I used that program. Once the sketch was finalized I needed to bring it to life starting with TinkerCAD. This was fairly easy because I uploaded a .stl file of he design I would remake which gave me a good start. I than only neede to add it might alterations to the design and doing so on TinkerCad what not hard because the chanes I made to the design I have practiced all before from the tutorial. This design can be seen on the top right of the image above. I kept the same design and alterations when creating it on Fusion meaning nothing needed to change and the process was simple. This can be seen on the right middle of the image above where fusion tried to be more specific with all the shapes and measurements as well as where my name was placed it was attempting to measure each indent in the base. But in the end it had no effect on the print and looked identical to the one made on TinkerCAD. Getting both of these files onto the prusa slicer was easy because both program allow for easy exporting as a .stl file which is the type needed for the slicer. Once in the slicer I experienced one problem, that the design was too big. It was tool tall that the slicer gave me a error message saying it was too large to print. To fix this I originally tried laying it down but even after doing that it was still slightly too big for the printing bed. To solve this I used the scaling factor to decrease the size little by little so I could have it fit on the bed at the largest size possible. I ended up scaling it to 89.3% of its original size. After fixing that problem there was one last part that needed working on. That was the fact that some of these parts mainly the hexagon on the middle would be printing on air now with the fact it was lying dow. So in the slicer I had it create me the recommende supports needed so that the print would work. This is seen in the bottom right of the image where the orange is the design and the neon green is the support. One this was done the print was able to be made. Overall I did achieve my goal because despite the print being a little smaller than I had hoped it ould still hold up my headphones and my earbuds could still fit on the hexagon in the middle. To optimise my design in the future one thing I would change is to make it into two parts. Where I would split it right before the curve of the print. This would allow me to make it taller because it would be two different prints and than I would put indents and grooves on the two separate pieces so they could click into place. Another element I might change would be two add a small opening into one of the sides of the print os that the charger of the headphones could fit through it and stay there.
