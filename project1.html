												<p>This was my first project using the program PrusaSlicer as well as the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer. Due to this I experienced many difficulties, Uploading the image to the slicer was fairly simple by just downloading the file to my computer than re uploading it. Despite the slicer looked overly complicated for this project all I needed to do was change the name on it and the layout of the words. After completing this and ejecting it properly onto the flash drive I just needed to upload it into the Printer. This was definitely the more difficult part of the project because all the steps were very specific and had to be completed in order. Before starting the print I needed to ensure the printer was on and working, than I had to insert the filament which is where you can become creative and chose the color that your print is going to be. Inputting the filament was a struggle because you had to time it with when the machine so that it would grab it. But once that was completed and the printer was pre heated you could select your print. This project was split into two part so that a color change could be done. The base was made first with a orange color so than when I started the second hald being the actuall name and outline of the nametag I could use a black filament to make it stand out more.</p>

																<p>TAfter completing this calibration project to put the limits of the Prusa Mini+ to the test it gave me a lot of valuable information that I can use for future projects. When uploading the project into the slicer everything was normal, I was given warming messages about the height because originally I was going to make this at a larger scale but I decided to shrink it down to avoid any problems. When it came to using the printer itself the setup was the same as normal with the uploading of the project from the flash drive as well as the process of choosing my filament color and inserting it into the printer. Once the project finished printing the cat itself was fine, the only problem I noticed was that there were very thing stringy pieces of filament around its head and tail. This was most likely caused by the printer being a little to hot causing the filament to be melting out of the printer and dragging while it was moving to the next part of the project. This was not a major problem and will be a easy fix for the next time I print. Besides that no other problems occurred showing me that this printer waas very mich capable of projects if this caliber and I could probably be even more complex next time and everything would still turn out ok.</p>

												<p>This project was a exnetions that could be used for a Xbox game controller. It has many purposes, some people who may have arthritis or general pain when it comes curling and behind their fingers to fit around the natural shape of the control can use this so they can keep their fingers more outstretechd and less bent. Also people who may have smaller hands like kids or adults could use this because the extension goes all the way to the side of the controller so the player no longer needs to reach as far to use the bumpers and triggers of the controller. This print came from the website “makers making change” specifically from a person with the username occupied_brain. The documentation could use some work bevcause for each part of the project being the extension for the bumpers, triggers, and the clip to fit onto the controller were there twice. Once as a .stl and another time as a .STEP file. Which made understanding what I needed to rpint confusing. Besides that as seen in the photo above the dimensions were all perfect where the extensions easily attached to the clip and the lcipped fit perfectly into the mold of the Xbox controller. Overall I wouldnt make any changes to the project itself because it serves its purpose perfectly but I would make the download instructions a bit clearer.</p>
