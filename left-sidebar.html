												<p>This was my first project using the program PrusaSlicer as well as the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer. Due to this I experienced many difficulties, Uploading the image to the slicer was fairly simple by just downloading the file to my computer than re uploading it. Despite the slicer looked overly complicated for this project all I needed to do was change the name on it and the layout of the words. After completing this and ejecting it properly onto the flash drive I just needed to upload it into the Printer. This was definitely the more difficult part of the project because all the steps were very specific and had to be completed in order. Before starting the print I needed to ensure the printer was on and working, than I had to insert the filament which is where you can become creative and chose the color that your print is going to be. Inputting the filament was a struggle because you had to time it with when the machine so that it would grab it. But once that was completed and the printer was pre heated you could select your print. This project was split into two part so that a color change could be done. The base was made first with a orange color so than when I started the second hald being the actuall name and outline of the nametag I could use a black filament to make it stand out more.</p>
