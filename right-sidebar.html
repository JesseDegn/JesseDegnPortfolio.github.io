										<p>After completing this calibration project to put the limits of the Prusa Mini+ to the test it gave me a lot of valuable information that I can use for future projects. When uploading the project into the slicer everything was normal, I was given warming messages about the height because originally I was going to make this at a larger scale but I decided to shrink it down to avoid any problems. When it came to using the printer itself the setup was the same as normal with the uploading of the project from the flash drive as well as the process of choosing my filament color and inserting it into the printer. Once the project finished printing the cat itself was fine, the only problem I noticed was that there were very thing stringy pieces of filament around its head and tail. This was most likely caused by the printer being a little to hot causing the filament to be melting out of the printer and dragging while it was moving to the next part of the project. This was not a major problem and will be a easy fix for the next time I print. Besides that no other problems occurred showing me that this printer waas very mich capable of projects if this caliber and I could probably be even more complex next time and everything would still turn out ok.
