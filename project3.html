										<p>Just from browsing through the instruction manual for building this radio, I knew it wouldn't be easy. I have never worked with this kind of engineering equipment before or done soldering, so it was all new to me. Thankfully, the instruction sheet for building the radio itself was pretty straightforward. I didn't have to know what every conductor did; I just had to know where it went. However, I did learn a lot about what they did while completing this project. I knew the main challenges for me were to make sure I soldered well enough for the pieces to stay and work, but not too much that it would cause bridging or any other problems. The only problem I faced with the manual itself is that it had pictures to show how to correctly place some of the items on the motherboard, which can be seen in the photo above. These images themselves were actually useful, but my partner and I originally thought those pictures were the only things we needed to put into the motherboard, so we ignored all the other pieces. Meaning that once we realized we had to go back and undo some areas, like the battery holder, so we could solder some areas under it, which was difficult. I feel this is my only real critique of the manual, just that they could have been clearer on the assembly. As well as the fact that my kit was actually missing a very important piece, which thankfully we had a backup of in the classroom.

											</p>
											<p>Before we started on the radio, we worked on a couple of test boards to learn how to solder, and I ended up frying the board a couple of times, but eventually I got the hang of it. But this made me a lot more cautious when working on the radio because I couldn't fry the board, because it was the only one I had. The process for soldering was fairly simple, as seen in the photo above. I used a bunch of wire arms with clips at the end so that the board could be held up to me without me having to touch it. Allowing me to use both my hands. In one hand, I would be holding the iron while in the other I was holding the solder itself. Since I started this project with my partner, our strategy for dividing up the work was to take turns after every step so we would both get lots of experience. We did this until she was able to get her own kit, where we then worked individually on our own projects. The radio does, in fact, work.

										<p>When starting the process of creating the case for my radio, I already had an Idea in mind. Where I wanted it as a simple box, but for the cover, I wanted openings for all the important pieces of the radio to be visible. These pieces were the knob to turn it on and off, the two red and yellow buttons that allowed for changing stations and fixing the signal, and opening for the red light to indicate that it was on, and then an opening for where the speaker was, so the sound didn't get blocked off or trapped inside the box. In order to create this, I first had to take measurements of the radio and all the pieces to determine how large the radio was, where on the radio they were, and the size of each of the pieces. This can be seen above on the piece of paper where I have everything measured out, which made the modeling process much easier. 

											</p>
											<p> The modeling and creation of the case I did on fusion. Since this was no longer my first time using Fusion, the princess was much easier. Along with the fact that I already had all the measurements, I just needed to transfer them to my 3D model. In the image above, you can see a screenshot of what my case looked like in Fusion. I had my box, which was hollowed out, and then I had all the shapes placed in the right spot and the correct size, where I just extruded them to make a cutout in my model. I originally left the back open because it was my first print, and I first wanted to make sure everything lined up correctly before I completed the entire thing. Which I'm glad I did because not all the spots lined up perfectly. Specifically, the opening for the knob. This can be seen above with the purple case, where the opening is a little too far to the right. This alignment took me a couple of tries to fix, but eventually I got it. Once I had that, I created a sliding back door that allowed for easy access to the battery so I could replace it whenever I needed to. This was something I had never done before on fusion, so it required outside research on the internet to figure out how to do it. In the end, I got everything to fit in place, and the case for the radio was completed. Which is the blue case in the image above.
