										<p>This project was a exnetions that could be used for a Xbox game controller. It has many purposes, some people who may have arthritis or general pain when it comes curling and behind their fingers to fit around the natural shape of the control can use this so they can keep their fingers more outstretechd and less bent. Also people who may have smaller hands like kids or adults could use this because the extension goes all the way to the side of the controller so the player no longer needs to reach as far to use the bumpers and triggers of the controller. This print came from the website “makers making change” specifically from a person with the username occupied_brain. The documentation could use some work bevcause for each part of the project being the extension for the bumpers, triggers, and the clip to fit onto the controller were there twice. Once as a .stl and another time as a .STEP file. Which made understanding what I needed to rpint confusing. Besides that as seen in the photo above the dimensions were all perfect where the extensions easily attached to the clip and the lcipped fit perfectly into the mold of the Xbox controller. Overall I wouldnt make any changes to the project itself because it serves its purpose perfectly but I would make the download instructions a bit clearer.
